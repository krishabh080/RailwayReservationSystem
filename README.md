**Project Title: Railway Reservation System**

**Project Description:**

The Railway Reservation System is a Java-based terminal application designed to simplify the process of booking and managing railway tickets. This project harnesses the power of Object-Oriented Programming to provide a user-friendly experience for railway travelers.

**Key Functionalities:**

1. **Train Information:** 
   - This module offers comprehensive information about available trains, considering source and destination stations, as well as the date of travel.
   - Notable Trains:
     - Mumbai to Delhi (Mumbai Superfast)
     - Delhi to Jaipur (Delhi SuperFast)
     - Prayagraj to Delhi (Prayagraj EXP)

2. **Seat Availability:** 
   - Users can easily check the availability of seats on their preferred train and view the available seat options.

3. **Booking:** 
   - This module enables users to book seats on their selected train. Passengers can provide their names and choose available seats.

4. **Canceling:** 
   - Users have the option to cancel their booked tickets conveniently within the system.

5. **Ticket Display:** 
   - This module displays comprehensive ticket details, including passenger names, seat numbers, train numbers, and fares.

6. **Error Handling:** 
   - The system effectively handles potential errors that may arise during operations, such as invalid inputs or attempting to book already reserved seats.

**Code Structure and Classes:**

**Train Class:** 
- Represents train details like name, source, destination, departure time, passenger strength, and train number.
- Provides a constructor to create train instances.

**Ticket Class:** 
- Represents ticket details, including passenger name, seat number, and train number.
- Offers a constructor for creating ticket instances.

**RailwayReservationSystem Class:** 
- The core class of the system, it manages the logic behind reservations.
- Contains two ArrayLists: one for storing train information and another for storing booked tickets.
- Tracks seat availability.

**Main Method:** 
- Runs an interactive menu-based interface for users to interact with the Railway Reservation System.
- Users can view train information, check seat availability, book and cancel tickets, display ticket details, or exit the system.
